# Rainbow-Kittens-Inventory-Project

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

Our project takes use of a user database to create an inventory of members of our site. By having multiple functions using Javascript, a person can add/delete one or all users.
The Page is easy to use and has helpful functions such as a search bar, a navigation bar, and alphabetized links to help navigate the page.
